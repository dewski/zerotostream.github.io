As an avid gamer my entire life, I can't help but watch the rise and success streamers have had over the last few years on platforms like Twitch and YouTube. And I want in.

Unless you are a popular news anchor in a large metropolitan area, actor in a Hollywood blockbuster, or a professional athlete playing in a championship game – you couldn't get in front 100,000+ people in a moments notice.

This relatively new phenomenon has enabled anyone to take something they're passionate about and captivate audiences that they would otherwise not be able to get in front of doing things they already do. You can come home one day and decide to start streaming – there are no prerequisites or credentials to get started. You can even make a career out of it if you're successful enough.

Every walk of life has seen success on platforms like Twitch and YouTube, from the introverts to celebrities, and everything in between. Everyone is accepted with open arms, you just have to find people who are interested in the same things you are. Anyone with an active internet connection could be a potential viewer watching you play your favorite video game, favorite instrument, programming the next Facebook, draw on your Etch A Sketch, or even tattoo someone.

Streamers face many of the same obstacles people in traditional media have typically faced. It still takes hard work, networking, creativity, adapting, and determination.

Zero To Stream is my personal attempt at documenting the process from having never streamed before, to hopefully reaching tens of thousands viewers at a time. I don't expect there is an exact formula for success on platforms like Twitch and YouTube, none that I've found anyway. Using this blog I want to highlight the successes and failures I have throughout this journey.

There many topics I want to explore and write about, such as:

- How to growing your channel
- Following the market
- Networking with other streamers
- Obtaining your first sponsor
- How to keep your stream interesting
- How to use YouTube to your advantage

These are mostly obstacles or questions I have had myself, turned in topics I want to tackle one-by-one. I invite you to join me on this journey and if I can help even just a little bit it, it will have all been worth it.

I also want to hear from you! Do you have any questions about streaming? Are you interested in streaming but something is holding you back?
