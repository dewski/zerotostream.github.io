Being an avid gamer my entire life, I can't help but be a fan and watch the
rise & success streaming personalities have had over the last few years on
platforms like Twitch and YouTube.

It has enabled people to take something they're passionate about and captivate audiences of 100,000+ people at a time. Unless you were a popular news anchor in a large metropolitan area, actor in a Hollywood blockbuster, or professional athlete playing in a championship game â€“ you couldn't reach that kind of audience.

atewho are naturally categorized as introverts captivate
audiences doing something they are good at.
